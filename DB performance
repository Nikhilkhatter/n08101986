top ten mistakes

1. BAD conenction management ( too many connections )
2. bad use of cursor and shared pool
3. badly coded sql
4. use of non standard init params
5. design database IO wrong
6. long fulll table scans
7. high amount of recursive sql
8. deployment and migrationn errors

DB tuning - 
avoid multiple connections to db - it is slowest process 
avoid multiple IO to Database
go atomic - divide and conquer
	use partitions,  local indexes, store data across multiple disks

use parallism
disk caching
use larger block size - this keeps more data in memory, compact dense packed, 

sql tuning - 

avoid unnecessary sort
use union all , use compute stats while creating index
avoid full table scans
avoid joining too many tables
try to use index clause in the where clause
use compaund index with care, avoid repeating columns
use shared cursor parameters
